                Hearing restoration is a process of restoring hearing in
                patients (very young children to adults- any age group) even
                with total hearing loss. MERF ISH is one of the leading centers
                for hearing restoration in the world. The clinic functions at
                different levels of assessment, treatment and management of
                disorders related hearing. The “state of the art” infrastructure
                with cutting-edge technology symbiozed with customized
                protocols, uncompromised ethics, work culture and professional
                expertise makes this clinic unique and one of the best in the
                world. Students and patients from all over the world visit MERF
                and MERF ISH for both learning and treatment. MERF & MERF ISH
                has established implantation centers across India and rest of
                the world
                <br />First surgery for hearing restoration was performed in
                1997 in MERF using Cochlear Implant, since then MERF has
                performed several thousands of Cochlear Implants to restore
                hearing in very young children and adults with hearing loss.
                MERF and MERF ISH have pioneered the art of hearing restoration
                in all kinds of anomalies causing hearing loss from moderately
                severe to profound degree. This made MERF & MERF ISH as center
                of excellence in hearing restoration. MERF & MERF ISH has been
                the trend setter in hearing restoration in this part of the
                world

                  First in Asia to perform Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) in
                  children with absent inner ear/nerve, and now the pioneering
                  center for ABI in children. MERF ISH & MERF is the third
                  biggest ABI center in the world. Students of MERF ISH are the
                  only students to have opportunity to observe, earn and
                  experience this most sophisticated procedure. This experience

                We are equipped with the latest technology hearing aid analyzer
                which can assess the functioning of the hearing in all
                parameters including in-situ measurement. At the same time the
                information from the analyzer will provide adequate information
                to optimize the parameters to suit your hearing needs. MERF ISH
                also has other measures to assess the benefit of the hearing aid
                using both psycho acoustical, electrophysiological data.
                Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials (HEAR Lab) developed at
                National Acoustic Laboratory (NAL), Australia is used to verify

                This is first and one of the best Center for re/habilitating
                children and adults with Cochlear Implant in India. This unique
                center was established in 2000, since then this had been the
                referral and training center for many teachers across the globe.
                Very active center with annual patient load of 150 and total
                number of therapy session per year around 14,500. The quality
                control of the center is monitored by experts from USA and
                Europe.
                <br />Auditory habilitation refers to the plan to improve the
                communication with younger children who have not yet attained
                spoken language following hearing loss. Rehabilitation focuses
                on restoring a skill of listening which was not acquired due to
                hearing loss. In children the skills may not be there so it has
                to be taught, hence it is called habilitation.

                and treated with all types ENT diseases and communication
                disorders. Students have the opportunity to visit villages, were
                no health awareness and facilities are available. The students
                are accompanied by professionals, were they learn the methods of
                screening and managing patients were the facilities are very
                minimal. As the part of the visit they also do awareness program
                to the people in the village.
                <br />As a result we have restored hearing for more than 1500
                children living in villages, were there is no medical facilities
                are available. Now these children have their normal hearing, age
                matched speech and language skills and leading a normal life.
                All most all the kids are in normal school, few older children
                are in universities performing their higher educations. Some of
                our children who received CI in early years are working
                Government sector, Private sector, Multi-National Companies And
                few have them have their own establishment.

              <p>
                The Vestibular system is one of the integral systems which helps
                in the maintenance of balance in the three dimensional space.
                There are various peripheral and central disorders of the
                vestibular system that leads to various symptoms like imbalance,
                vertigo and dizziness. Dizziness is a symptom that can vary from
                mild unsteadiness to a severe whirling sensation accompanied by
                nausea and vomiting.  The treatment of dizziness depends on its
                cause(s) and may consist of medicine, surgery, counseling,
                and/or rehabilitative measures. After the diagnosis is made,
                patients are managed with a wide variety of medical, surgical,
                and/or rehabilitative treatments. The clinic is headed by Dr
                SathyaMurali and a team of doctors and skilled audiologists
                perform the tests. The goal of the vestibular / balance clinic
                at MERF is to work with the family, primary health care
                provider, other professionals and also with the patient to
                improve their quality of life and help them to return to their
                maximum level of activity. The vestibular / balance clinic
                consists of the state of the art facility for appropriate
                diagnosis and management of these conditions. The vestibular
                test battery carried out here consists of the subjective tests
                and objective tests. The procedures carried out include
                Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP), Videonystomography
                (VNG), Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and caloric testing.Patients are
                diagnosed and treated effectively in the most cost-efficient
                manner possible.The test results are also compared with the
                other audiological findings to give a holistic treatment to the
                patient.
